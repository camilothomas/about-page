	I took four semesters of German at Austin Community College, after which
	I lived in Leipzig and Berlin for a total of one year and a half.
	I met with lots of language exchange partners in Leipzig.  It was a great
	place to find compatible language partners.  Most German adults from West Germany speak English well, but those from East Germany made excellent language exchange partners because they were more patient with someone struggling to learn German.  When our hour of English was done, they were always exhausted and eager to switch to German.
