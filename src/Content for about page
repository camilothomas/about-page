> German

	After four semesters of German at Austin Community College,
	I spent a year and a half in Leipzig and Berlin.
	Leipzig was a great
	place to find compatible language partners.  East German adults were not taught English while Germany was divided.  When our hour of English was done, they were always exhausted and eager to switch to German.

    My first big trip abroad was to Madrid, Spain in 2004.  When I arrived, I
    hardly spoke any Spanish.  When I left, five months later, I still didn't speak
    that well.  It has only been through years of immersion that included a
    return to Madrid in 2007 and a year in Mexico City in 2009 that I have
    become bilingual.

		It still takes a lot of practice and I need to seek help to improve.  I use

		  The Mixxer

		 to meet language exchange partners for Skype chats and to receive help and
		give help with writing.

> Travel

	Travelling has been my second nature.
	Now it is time to settle down.  I haven't been on an airplane since May 2017.
	I am sure that I will travel again, but I am okay with that.
	I do love to look at the pictures, and remember the good times.
