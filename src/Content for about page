> German

	I took four semesters of German at Austin Community College.
	Then, I spent a year and a half in Leipzig and Berlin.
	I had lots of language exchange partners in Leipzig.  It was a great
	place to find compatible language partners.  Most German adults from West Germany speak English well, but those from East Germany were not taught English while Germany was divided.  Therefore, they were at a similar level with someone struggling to learn German.  When our hour of English was done, they were always exhausted and eager to switch to German.

> Travel

	Travelling has been my second nature.
	Now it is time to settle down.  I haven't been on an airplane since May 2017.
	I am sure that I will travel again, but I am okay with that.
	I do love to look at the pictures, and remember the good times.
