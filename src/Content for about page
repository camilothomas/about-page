> German

	After four semesters of German at Austin Community College,
	I spent a year and a half in Leipzig and Berlin.
	Leipzig was a great
	place to find compatible language partners.  East German adults were not taught English while Germany was divided.  When our hour of English was done, they were always exhausted and eager to switch to German.

> Travel

	Travelling has been my second nature.
	Now it is time to settle down.  I haven't been on an airplane since May 2017.
	I am sure that I will travel again, but I am okay with that.
	I do love to look at the pictures, and remember the good times.
